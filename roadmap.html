<h1><a class="anchor" id="roadmap">Road Map </a></h1><p>This road map is a very rough guide as to our plans for future development and is contingent on resourcing, which due to the nature of the VFX Industry can change at a moments notice!</p>
<p>Many of the tasks below have been completed in internal proprietary software already and released to production, the work required is to ready them for public release. Others have been started in a different form and need to be adapted and finished. Some are merely ideas at this stage and need to be discussed, designed and developed.</p>
<p>We are very interested in hearing about the needs of software vendors and of other VFX studios. Please do get in touch if there is a particular feature you'd like to receive greater priority and we will endeavour to adapt to this in our plans. In addition, as the library is still very new, any existing aspects of the library that you think could be improved, we are very keen on hearing your ideas.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="sShortTerm">
Short Term (1 month - 3 months)</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sHoudiniViewportGroups">
Visualize only a Specific Group in the Viewport (Houdini)</a></h3>
<p>Very large point sets make the Houdini viewport particularly slow. This will introduce the ability to specify a group as metadata on the PointDataGrid so the viewport only renders this group for performance. There will be a custom implementation that creates a group based on an arbitrary attribute such as id and some input options (maximum point count, point percent, etc).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sPointRasterization">
Point Density Rasterization (Core API / Houdini)</a></h3>
<p>Rasterizing points into a scalar density grid is a very useful operations, particularly for FLIP simulations. Introducing this to the toolset will result in a faster way of rasterizing this data. We intend to introduce a SOP for Houdini as well.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sPackedPrims">
Packed Primitives (Houdini)</a></h3>
<p>Packed primitives in Houdini are an efficient way of supporting delayed load of geometry data. This work will be extending the OpenVDB Points SOP to support converting Houdini packed point prims without requiring the user to unpack them first for convenience.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sArraysOfArrays">
Array-of-array attributes (Core API)</a></h3>
<p>Storing array attributes (ie an array for an attribute of a point) is already supported in Houdini 14 for native Houdini points and a feature we would like to introduce to the library. This would also introduce the ability to natively store curve data. This would serve to further stabilise the Core API and file format which is our current focus.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sHoudiniPointVisualiser">
OpenVDB Point Visualizer SOP (Houdini)</a></h3>
<p>The OpenVDB Visualizer SOP is handy for visualizing the topology of the tree. This is particularly useful for OpenVDB Points where the voxel size no longer has quite the same meaning as for level sets and volumes. Ideally the OpenVDB Visualizer SOP should be extended to allow registering new types to visualize.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sMediumTerm">
Medium Term (3 months - 6 months)</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sStringAttributes">
String Attributes (Core API)</a></h3>
<p>Introducing support for being able to store string attributes.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sPointScatter">
OpenVDB Points Scatter SOP (Houdini)</a></h3>
<p>The OpenVDB Scatter SOP provides an easy way of scattering points inside a level set and at the narrow band. This SOP will provide identical implementation except to scatter OpenVDB Points instead of Houdini points.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sPointSurfacing">
Point Surfacing (Core API / Houdini)</a></h3>
<p>Rasterizing points into a level set surface is a very useful operations, particularly for FLIP simulations. Introducing this to the toolset will result in a faster way of doing this. We intend to introduce a SOP for Houdini as well.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sLongTerm">
Long Term (6 months - 12 months)</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sAutoVoxelSize">
Target Points-Per-Voxel for Conversion (Core API / Houdini)</a></h3>
<p>The voxel size has a subtly different meaning for OpenVDB Points as to using OpenVDB for level sets and volumes. This tool introduces a target points-per-voxel count that can be used to help users choose an appropriate voxel size. This feature will also be exposed as a default on the OpenVDB Points SOP.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sPointAttribute">
OpenVDB Points Attribute SOP (Houdini)</a></h3>
<p>This SOP will provide the ability to add and remove attributes from an existing OpenVDB Points grid (further implementation to come).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sPointRayIntersector">
PointRayIntersector (Core API)</a></h3>
<p>A custom RayIntersector and LinearSearchImpl designed for OpenVDB Points. The native vdb_render application will be the intended target application. Like the native VDB ray-tracing, there will be no support for motion blur.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sPointSampling">
Point Sampling (Core API / Houdini)</a></h3>
<p>This task is to be able to sample volume data onto a point attribute.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sPointAdvection">
Point Sort / Point Advection (Core API / Houdini)</a></h3>
<p>Sorting is a pre-requisite to being able to advect points. Due to the spatially organised nature of the points, moving them requires tracking their relative offsets and applying a subsequent sorting. The ability to advect points based on a VDB vector field is already provided inside OpenVDB for native Houdini points. The SOP interface would be similar to that of the OpenVDB version.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sPointResample">
Point Resample (Core API / Houdini)</a></h3>
<p>This task is to be able to resample existing point attributes into a grid with a different voxel size. It is expected this would be an extension of the OpenVDB Points SOP.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="sPointMerge">
Point Merge (Core API / Houdini)</a></h3>
<p>Merging multiple OpenVDB Points grids will result in a single OpenVDB Points grid that contains all the point sets co-located in one. </p>
